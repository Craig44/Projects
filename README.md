# Projects
For Personal work and interests. My interests include developing statistical catch at age/size models, researching Bayesian methods for estimation, Multispecies models, spatially explicit population models and implementing State space methods, just to list a few. I am keen to collaborate with others on these areas. If you are interested send me an email at Craig.Marsh@niwa.co.nz
